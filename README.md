# WeatherAnalysis
The project was aimed to analyse the weather data set in Australia in 2020 to predict the occurrence of rain tomorrow using R software. Data pre-processing is performed to make the data set suitable for model fitting. The project identified the most important variables in predicting the occurrence of rain tomorrow and built a few classification models using the most important variables.
